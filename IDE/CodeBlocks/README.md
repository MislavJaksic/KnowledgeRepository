## [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)

CodeBlocks is a free C/C++ IDE for both Windows and Linux.  

### [Installation](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide/)

Windows: install CodeBlocks using a binary file "*mingw-setup*".  

Optionally, you can also set the "Settings" -> "Compiler...".  
Follow the "learncpp" guide, chapters 0.x on how to setup "Compiler...".  

Optionally, you can also set the "Settings" -> "Editor..." -> "Source Formatter".  
Java with the following options checked works for me:  
* indent size : 2  
* convert TABs to spaces  
* pad around operators  
* pad between a header and the following paren  
* remove extra padding  
* padding after commas
