[Agile Manifesto: Explained](http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/agileManifesto.html)

```
Individuals and interactions > processes and tools
* It is more important to have competent people working together effectively
Working software             > comprehensive documentation
* Development is about creating software, not documentation
Customer collaboration       > contract negotiation
* A contract is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need
Responding to change         > following a plan
* Accommodate changes in technology or the environment
```

Principles:
* deliver software early and continuously
* embrace change
* deliver software in short intervals
* business people and developers must work together throughout the project
* build projects and support environments around motivated and trusted individuals
* conveying information face-to-face
* working software is the primary measure of progress
* maintain a constant pace indefinitely
* technical excellence and good design enhances agility
* simplicity is essential
* use self-organizing teams
* teams reflect on how to become more effective
