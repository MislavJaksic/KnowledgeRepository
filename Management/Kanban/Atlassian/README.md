## [Kanban Overview](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)

Kanban is an implementation of agile principles.  
It requires real-time communication and work transparency.  
It is a just-in time methodology.  
Kanban matches the amount of work in progress (WIP) to team's capacity.  

You will need:  
* a board  
* cards  

A Kanban board visualizes the flow of work.  

A basic three-step workflow:  
* To-Do  
* In-Progress/Doing  
* Done  

You may want to add other steps such as code review.  

Kanban cards should only include critical information.  

The benefits of Kanban are:
* planning flexibility: cards are plucked from the top of the backlog
* short time cycle: cycle time should be as short as possible; overlapping skills reduce cycle time; share skills with others
* fewer bottlenecks: don't multitask, do your work in progress
* visual metrics: you can use control charts and cumulative flow diagrams to remove bottlenecks
* continuous delivery: integrate and deliver all the time
