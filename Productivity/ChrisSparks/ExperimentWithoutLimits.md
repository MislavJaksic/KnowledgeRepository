## Experiment Without Limit

Chapters stand on their own. Feel free to skip.  
Invest. You only get what you put in.  

### Goal Generation

Generate them through stories, values or taking the outside view.  
Think big.  
Use one of three types of prompts.  

#### Life Story

Write a life story.  
Shift your thinking from happiness to what is most meaningful.  

I dream about examining the stars.  
I dream about making a strategy game.  
I dream about teaching.  
I dream about leading an institution.  
I dream about piloting an aeroplane.  
I dream about living on another planet.  
I dream about creating a herbarium.  

#### Values

Prioritize your values.  
How do you want to spend your days?  

#### Take the Outside View

Be objective.  
How can you make the most in your current situation and with your current knowledge and skills?  

### Goal Selection

#### Minimize Opportunity Cost

The lost value of an unselected goal when an alternative goal is selected.  

Intermediate goals of `Leading an Institution`:
* `Improve health`
* `Find new ideas`
* `Find niches I can solve`
* `Meet capable people`

#### Maximize Expected Value

### Goal Framing

`SMART` goal:
* Specific: pinpoint what you want and how to achieve it
* Measurable: create measurements to track your progress
* Actionable: an input (not: "4% body fat", "get rich"; these are outcomes)
* Rewarding: should be challenging and meaningful
* Time-Based: has a clear endpoint or deadline

#### Experiments

Think of your life as an experiment and your goals as hypotheses.  
Commit for a month and then review them.  
How can you improve? Do you still think a goal is worth pursuing?  

Experiment:
* STEP 1: What is a SMART goal that could improve your life?
* STEP 2: What are the hypotheses that need to be tested?
* STEP 3: Which hypothesis is critical to the experimentâ€™s success? What is the result necessary to support completion on this goal?
* STEP 4: How will you quickly test this hypothesis? How will you adjust if your test does not have the desired result?

`Improve health`:
* by exercising at home three times a week following a Nike Workout phone app Getting Started plan for four weeks I'll increase my functional strength
* review exercises the morning before exercising
* find replacement exercises if necessary  
* during morning routine (~6:35)

`Find new ideas`:
* read a book for two hours or a chapter, whichever comes first
* do it four times a week
* during evening routine (~20:30)
* until you read it
* take notes

`Find niches I can solve`:
* Hacker News? Job postings? Open Source Projects?
* do `Cracking the Coding Interview` or `HackerRank` or `LeetCode` or `FireCode`
* commit two hours to doing a personal project

`Meet capable people`:
* every Friday at 18:00 I'll call a friend that I haven't heard from the longest
* arrange a meeting, coffee or just chat over the phone

Note: optimize goals and priorities only on Friday 19:00

### Designing Systems

Develop systems to drive lasting behavioral changes.  
Three principals:
* bottlenecks
* feedback loops
* leverage

#### Bottleneck

Steps:
* where would you like to accelerate progress?
* write down constraints for five minutes
* choose the bottleneck constraint
* write down actions to reduce the constraint for five minutes
* pick an action and track your progress towards

#### Feedback Loop

Systems where outputs effect the inputs.  

Balancing feedback loops maintain the status quo.  
Reinforcing feedback loops amply behavior.  
Improvement loop is made of planning, experimenting and reflecting.  
Increase the frequency of measurement and experimentation.  

Build an improvement loop based on a SMART goal.  

#### Leverage

Ability to return maximum results per unit of effort.  
Pareto's principle or the 80/20 rule illustrates leverage perfectly.  

Greatest points of leverage:
* change goals and values, realign the system
* build self-organizing systems that improve over time
* improve information flow, take better measurements
* install feedback loops
* shorten the loop, measure and respond more quickly

### Building Habits

Discipline is a collection of strong habits.  

#### Upstream Effects

If you repeat a habit, it becomes more ingrained.  
Actions taken to change your habits precede the habit change.  

#### Habit Loop

Habit loop is made up of triggers, behaviors and rewards.  

##### Habit Triggers

TODO

### Creating Routines
### Maximizing Time
### Maximizing Attention
### Maximizing Energy
### Overcoming Procrastination
### Mental Game
### Accelerating Learning
