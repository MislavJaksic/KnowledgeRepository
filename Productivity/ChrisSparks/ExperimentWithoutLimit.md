### Goal Framing

`SMART` goal:
* Specific: pinpoint what you want and how to achieve it
* Measurable: create measurements to track your progress
* Actionable: an input (not: "4% body fat", "get rich"; these are outcomes)
* Rewarding: should be challenging and meaningful
* Time-Based: has a clear endpoint or deadline
