### Goal Framing

`SMART` goal:
* Specific: pinpoint what you want and how to achieve it
* Measurable: create measurements to track your progress
* Actionable: an input (not: "4% body fat", "get rich"; these are outcomes)
* Rewarding: should be challenging and meaningful
* Time-Based: has a clear endpoint or deadline

#### Experiments

Think of goals as experiments.  
Commit for a month and then review them.  
How can you improve your goals? Do you still think they are worth pursuing?  

Experiment:
* STEP 1: What is a SMART goal that could improve your life?
* STEP 2: What are the hypotheses that need to be tested?
* STEP 3: Which hypothesis is critical to the experimentâ€™s success? What is the result necessary to support completion on this goal?
* STEP 4: How will you quickly test this hypothesis? How will you adjust if your test does not have the desired result?
