## [Productivity and Goal Setting with Chris Sparks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv18o9wwFiE)

How do you know what you want to achieve? What do you want?  
`Goal`!  

The biggest cost?  
`Opportunity cost`!  
Everything you give up to achieve a `Goal`.  

Do what you do best and `Delegate` everything else.  

Align `Priorities`.  
A third person must be able to tell your `Priorities` based on how you spend your time.  
"Rebalance your time portfolio." Shed activities.  

What could you want?
Goal setting prompts:
* "What would you attempt if you knew could not fail?"
* "What would you do if money was unnecessary?"
* "What do you want you obituary to say?"
* "If you were the last person of Earth, what would you do?"
* "If you were an outsider what advice would you give yourself?"

Whittle down the list of wants with:
* `Opportunity cost`
* `Expected value`

`Expected Value Calculator` helps you compare goals.  
If you expected a different score, dive into your assumptions, uncover biases.  

Externalize thinking!  
Use a calendar or other tools to offload "brain bandwidth".

`Routine` is a collection of `Habit`s.  
`Routine`s chain `Habit`s, builds momentum. Keeps you going.  
Start with a `Morning Routine`.  
Get an `Evening Routine`. Have a hard cut-off for screens and meals an hour before sleeping.  

Make it easier to do what you want to do.  
Make it harder to do things you don't want to do.  

You don't fail, you create data points. Think about them.  
You improve what you measure.  

`SMART` goal:
* Specific: pinpoint what you want and how to achieve it
* Measurable: create measurements to track your progress
* Actionable: an input (not: "4% body fat", "get rich"; these are outcomes)
* Rewarding: should be challenging and meaningful
* Time-Based: has a clear endpoint or deadline
