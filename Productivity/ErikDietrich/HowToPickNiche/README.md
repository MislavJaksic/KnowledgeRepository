## [How to pick a Niche](https://daedtech.com/how-to-pick-a-niche/)

Frameworks:
* `Generalist`: optimize for employability
* `Specialist`: merge hobby and job, a narrow `Generalist`
* `Niche-filler`: optimize for delivering value to others

`Niche` is what other people want.  
It has nothing to do with your skills or knowledge.  

How to find a `Niche`:
* `Stack Exchange`, `Quora`, `Reddit` or the like: questions with lots of traffic and no consensus
* unimplemented project features: can you do construct it?
* read negative reviews: can you improve it?
* find debates: can you add clarity?
* look for keyword search patterns: what matches?
* listen to pains of other people: can you offer a solution?
* ask and listen to what others tell you: active search!

Grow the list of `Niche`s.  

Turn your CV, portfolio website or profile content into `Niche`s, just follow the money. Write why you were payed.
