## [Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr or TopTal? How to Pick a Freelancing Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pzL7oI46IU)

Sales and marketing are easier with a platform then using your own website.  
Eventually create your own website and transition.  Easier if you already have clients or a background you can tap.   

Progression of money and difficulty:
* non-curated platform. e.g. Onsite, Upwork, Fivver
* curated platform: e.g. Toptal
* your own website

Build your profile on all three.  
This project will take about 2 years.  
Have a link that you can use to redirect from a platform to your own website when you transition.  

## [I Tried Freelance Programming for a WEEK on Upwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEzlMdFOFoM)

7 days on Upwork.  
Sent about 24 proposals. After 24h heard nothing.  
Added portfolio and lowered hourly rate from 20 to 15 $/h.  
First interview was awful.  
Spent around 6h and 10 dollars for signup and proposal writing.  
Upwork takes 20%.  

Taking clients from Upwork is a finable offense.  
Build your own client base.  

## [I Spent 30 Days Freelancing on Upwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARqAJQo24rs)

30 days on Upwork.  
Five star reviews increase your pay.  
Made a 50 $/h when complained that it's not worth it.  
Upwork is a grind. In one word: "meh".  

Upwork should only be used to supplement your income due to high competition and low wages.  

## [Why I don't work for FAANG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhr3yxYf-P0)

Be careful about being obsessed about FAANG: you will attend meetings, .  
Inefficiencies of office life: long meetings, going through an elaborate process.  
Working hard, being ambitious and achieving great results will not be compensated. Switches your mental model from "do your best" to "do just enough".  
It's much better to be a bad manger then being managed by one.  

Use the Internet as a mentor instead of FAANG.  
If you want to get good at starting a company, start a company.
