Languages are subdivided into folders and then they are further subdevided by topic. Topics range from how to setup
a language to constructs such as lambda expressions. Each folder has a simple program designed to teach the

> _comment_explaining_the_expression_or_statement
> _expression_or_statement _single_comment_sign -> _result
