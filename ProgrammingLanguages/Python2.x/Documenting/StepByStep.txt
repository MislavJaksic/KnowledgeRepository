Setup, generate html docs:
1) Position your command line in <top level project folder> (tutorial name: "triangle-project")
2) Type "sphinx-build" and you should see a lot of text
3) Type "sphinx-quickstart" and answer all the questions (consult the handout.pdf)
4) Folder called doc will be created with conf.py
5) You can change conf.py if you mess up the quickstart (it conteins many useful settings)
6) Position your command line into doc folder
7) Type "make html" and open _build/html/index.html to see your documentation
---Optional---
8) To use autodoc open up conf.py and uncomment or change to sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
8a) You have to add <top level project folder> to sys.path
9) To change the style of documentation, change html_theme in conf.py
9a) View styles at sphinx.org
10) You can destroy eveything that was created with "make" with "make clean"

Step by step write api.py guide:
1) Position your command line in doc
2) Create an empty file api.rst and open it
3) Read RST Quick Reference in the handout.pdf to see the RST syntax
4) Write a part of api.rst, such as the title:
My Title
========
5) Edit index.rst and link api.rst to it
6) Link by putting three spaces before the name of the file, api
7) Type "make html" to refresh the html files
8) To generate docs from .py files, open up api.rst and write: 
.. automodule:: trianglelib
   :members:
---Optional---
9) You can look up how to use autodoc with sphinx at sphinx.org, extensions
