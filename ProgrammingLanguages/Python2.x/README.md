## Python 2.x

Python is an interpreted language that uses indents as an end of statement symbol and uses duck typing that
doesn't require users to write a formal data declaration. Because Python uses an interpreter the program's
source code cannot be hidden because the executable program and the source code are one and the same. Python
has thousands of well documented libraries.
