## Setting up Python

Python is an interpreter language with a simple and graceful syntax. Interpreter languages have an
interpreter program. As a consequence, there is no distinction between source files and executable files.

### Python distribution

Python files are distinguished by the .py extension. In order to executed a Python file, you need to install
a Python distribution. A Python distribution is a Python interpreter bundled up with Python libraries.
Different distributions have different library bundles. A library is a group of programs that solve a problem.
The smallest Python distribution can be found on the official Python website. A recommended Python distribution
is Python Anaconda as it comes with many powerful libraries.

### Python interpreter

Python interpreter can be called by typing "python" into the command line. The command will bring up a
sandpit where commands can be tested, explored and played with. To exit the sandpit, press CTRL + Z.

### Execute a program

To make the interpreter execute a Python program, position the command line in the folder where the .py
file is located, then type "python <file_name.py>" to run the program.
