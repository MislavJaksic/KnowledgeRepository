## Setup

C++ is a compiled, strongly typed language that allows the user to manipulate memory allocation.  
C++ is very fast, but complex and verbose.  

### Setting up without an IDE

I wouldn't recommend it. Linking, compiling and complex command line parameters make programming without an IDE very hard.  

### [IDE: CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)

CodeBlocks is a very simple C/C++ IDE for both Windows and Linux.
