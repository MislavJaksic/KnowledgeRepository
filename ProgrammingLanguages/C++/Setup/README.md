## Setup

C is the first language (beside Pascal) that I learned... and forgot. It is compiled, just like Java; it is
exceptionally fast, but it makes you juggle with memory allocation.

### [IDE: CodeBlocks](https://github.com/MislavJaksic/KnowledgeRepository/tree/master/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment/CodeBlocks)

It is recommended that you install CodeBlocks, as it will help you get started with the language.
