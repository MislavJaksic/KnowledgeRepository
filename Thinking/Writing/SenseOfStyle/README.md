## Sense of Style

### Prologue

Style manuals can be considered a literary genre.  
Strunk and White's (The Element of Style) gems:  
* "Write with nouns and verbs"
* "Put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end"
* "Omit needless words"

Style is the effective use of words to engage the human mind.  
Strunk and White mis-define terms, appeal to the reader's "ear" and give contradicting advice.  
Language changes over time and their style guides, written in the beginning of the previous century should be adapted as well.  
Examples of nonsensical or bad advice:
* don't use the passive (often argued for in the passive voice)
* don't use verbs "personalize", "finalize", "host", "chair" and "debut"
* use "persons" not "people"

Don't confuse changes in yourself with changes in the world or changes in the world with moral decline — the illusion of the good old days.  
Scepticism and questioning demand reasons for why writers should follow advice in of a style guide.  
These reasons can now be given.  

The Sense of Style is for those who:
* know how to write and want to be better at it
* are curious about literature and the science of writing

Style still matters because:
* it ensures that writers will get their messages across
* style earns trust
* adds beauty to the world

### Chapter 1: Good Writing

Good writers are avid readers.  
Examining good prose is more pleasurable then obeying stern advice.  

Good writing starts strong, not with a cliché or a banality.  
Use parallel constructions.  
Use colourful, poetic language, vivid imagery and uncommon superlatives.  
Make use of the mind's eye, conjure images with unusually precise descriptions.  
Write with nouns and verbs.  
When choosing between expressing yourself using a plain or a fancy word, always choose plain.  
Varied vocabulary and unusual words grab attention.  
Be wary of dehumanizing, euphemistic language.  
Don't say, show.  

### Chapter 2: A Window onto the World

Writing is a one way street. No one is coming in the other direction.  
Imagine your readers. Imagine them talking to you.  
Classic style is about orienting the reader's gaze. It is not about arguing or thinking out loud. Let the reader see the truth for himself.  
Classic prose shows the reader concrete things and engages him in conversation.  
Use analogies to everyday objects and events.  
Classic style is direct.  

Signpost, meta-discuss, sparingly: writing about what you will write next.  
Instead, formulate a question or use just enough key words to make a self-contained summary.  
Don't talk about your guild or profession, talk about the subject.  
Don't write self-consciously: assume a subject is controversial, complex and difficult.  
Don't hedge, be confident. Specify under which circumstances your statement is wrong.  
Don't use intensifiers such as 'very'.  
Don't use clichés. Unpack idioms and play with the image.  
Don't use meta-concepts, concepts about concepts: level, condition, context, level, ...  
Don't turn verbs, actions, into nouns, objects, or adjectives, descriptions.  
Use first instead of second person pronouns.  

### Chapter 3: The Curse of Knowledge

It's difficult to imagine what other people don't know.  
Related to it are: egocentrism, hindsight bias, false consensus, illusory transparency and mind-blindness.  
Imagine the reader helps, but not a lot.  
Avoid jargon and abbreviations.  
Use examples and explain terms with a handful of adjectives.  
Chunking: bundling data. M D P H D R S V P C E O I H O P into MD PHD RSVP CEO IHOP.  
Useful only if another person knows about the chunk.  
You would rather confuse then be condescending by spelling out chunks. Do the opposite.  
Clarity is not the same as condescension. It's in how you tell it.  
Functional fixity: thinking how to use it, not what it is and what's it made of. Reverse it.  
Use material, concrete, everyday words to invoke an image in the reader.  
Show a draft to another person. Ask him if it's clear.  
Show a draft to yourself after some time has passed.  

### Chapter 4: The Web, the Tree and the String

Reed-Kellogg notation creates diagrams from sentences.  
Grammar rules help us share ideas.  
Syntax turns a web of thoughts into an array of words.  
Grammatical categories:
* nouns
* verbs
* prepositions
* adjectives
* adverbs
* articles and determinatives
* coordinators
* subordinators

Rules of syntax specify the order of categories.  
Grammatical functions:
* head
* object
* subject
* predicate
* modifier
* determiner

Head can stand alone, instead of the whole phrase. You can add as many words to it as you like.  
Object is a noun phrase following a verb.  
Subject does the verb. It sits outside the verb phrase.  
Determiner answers:
* "How many?"
* "Which one?"

Semantic categories:
* action
* physical object
* possessor
* doer
* done-to

Don't confuse grammatical functions with categories.  
Trees link ideas.  
Rules:
* agreement (singular/plural agreement)
* movement rule (who, what, where and others come first)
Noam Chomsky's surface structure.  
Branches of coordination, conjunctions, are phrases connected with a coordinator. Phrases must be able to stand alone.  
Carefully assign case to pronouns. Nominative, accusative and genitive pronouns each have a place in a sentence.  
Who is nominative, whom is accusative. Who kissed the bride? Whom did Henry kiss?  

Prime directive: omit needless words!  
Trim obese phrases, remove light verbs (make, do, have, ...) and avoid talking about concepts of concepts.  
Keep phrases short and to the point.  
Create right-branching, not left-branching trees. Don't create noun piles.  
Read your sentence aloud. Can you do it easily?  
How to avoid garden paths:
* prosody: read it aloud
* punctuation: helps with prosody and marks phrases
* words that signal syntactic structure: small words (the, are, that, which is, ...) signal phrases
* frequent strings and senses: use the most frequent pair of words (data point, horse race, ...)
* structural parallelism: repeat parts of the previous tree structure
* attachment to the phrase next door: pull unrelated phrases apart; use subject-verb-object
* save heavy phrases for last: put ambiguous phrases and analogies at the end of a sentence
* topic, then comment: put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end; append new information at the end

Subject before object, light before heavy phrases, topic before comment.  
To achieve such structure use:
* rewrite with the opposite verb (gave, received, ...)
* passive voice
* preposing moves phrases to the left
* postposing, prepositional dative, existential and extraposed clause move phrases to the right
* clefting inverts ordering
* pseudo-clefting presupposes information
