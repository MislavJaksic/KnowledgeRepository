## Sense of Style

### Prologue

Style is the effective use of words to engage the human mind.  
Style manuals can be considered a literary genre.  
Strunk and White's (`The Element of Style`) gems:  
* `Write with nouns and verbs`
* `Put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end`
* `Omit needless words`

However, Strunk and White mis-define terms, appeal to the reader's `ear` and give contradicting advice.  
Language changes over time and so should style guides.  
Examples of nonsensical or bad advice:
* don't use the passive (often argued for in the passive voice)
* don't use verbs `personalize`, `finalize`, `host`, `chair` and `debut`
* use `persons` not `people`

`The Sense of Style` is for those who:
* know how to write and want to be better at it
* are curious about literature and the science of writing

Style still matters because:
* it ensures that writers will get their messages across
* style earns trust
* it adds beauty to the world

### Chapter 1: Good Writing

Good writers are avid readers.  
Examining good prose is more pleasurable then obeying stern advice.  

Good writing starts strong, not with a cliché or a banality.  
Use parallel constructions, use contrasting words to make the same point.  
Use colourful, poetic language, vivid imagery and uncommon superlatives.  
Make use of the mind's eye: conjure images with unusually precise descriptions.  
Write with nouns and verbs.  
Use plain rather then fancy words.  
Varied vocabulary and unusual words grab attention.  
Be wary of dehumanizing, euphemistic language.  
Don't say, show.  

### Chapter 2: A Window onto the World

Writing is a one way street, unlike a converstation.  
Imagine your readers. Imagine them talking to you.  

Classic style is about orienting the reader's gaze.  
Classic style isn't about arguing or thinking out loud.  
Let the reader see the truth for himself.  
Classic prose shows the reader concrete things and engages him in conversation.  
Use analogies to everyday objects and events.  
Classic style is direct.  

Signpost and meta-discuss, sparingly. Don't write about what you will write next.  
Formulate a question or use just enough key words to make a self-contained summary.  
Don't talk about your guild or profession, talk about the subject.  
Don't write self-consciously: assume a subject is controversial, complex and difficult.  
Don't hedge, be confident. Specify under which circumstances your statement is wrong.  
Don't use intensifiers such as `very`.  
Don't use clichés. Unpack idioms and play with the image.  
Don't use meta-concepts, concepts about concepts: level, condition, context, level, ...  
Don't turn verbs, actions, into nouns, objects, or adjectives, descriptions.  
Use first instead of second person pronouns.  

### Chapter 3: The Curse of Knowledge

It's difficult to imagine what other people don't know.  
Related concepts: egocentrism, hindsight bias, false consensus, illusory transparency and mind-blindness.  
Imagining the reader helps, but not a lot.  

Avoid jargon and abbreviations.  
Use examples and explain terms with a handful of adjectives.  
Chunking: bundling data. `M D P H D R S V P C E O I H O P` can be bundled into `MD PHD RSVP CEO IHOP`.  
Useful only if another person knows about the chunk.  
You would rather confuse then be condescending by spelling out chunks. Do the opposite.  
Clarity is not the same as condescension. It's in how you tell it.  
Functional fixity: thinking how to use it, not what it is and what's it made of. Reverse it.  
Use material, concrete, everyday words to invoke an image in the reader.  

Show a draft to another person. Ask him if it's clear.  
Show a draft to yourself after some time has passed.  

### Chapter 4: The Web, the Tree and the String

Reed-Kellogg notation creates diagrams from sentences.  
Grammar rules help us share ideas.  
Syntax turns a web of thoughts into an array of words.  
Grammatical categories:
* nouns
* verbs
* prepositions
* adjectives
* adverbs
* articles and determinatives
* coordinators
* subordinators

Rules of syntax specify the order of categories.  
Grammatical functions:
* head
* object
* subject
* predicate
* modifier
* determiner

Head can stand alone, instead of the whole phrase. You can add as many words to it as you like.  
Object is a noun phrase following a verb.  
Subject does the verb. It sits outside the verb phrase.  
Determiner answers:
* `How many?`
* `Which one?`

Semantic categories:
* action
* physical object
* possessor
* doer
* done-to

Don't confuse grammatical functions with categories.  
Trees link ideas.  
Rules:
* agreement (singular/plural agreement)
* movement rule (who, what, where and others come first)

Noam Chomsky's surface structure.  
Branches of coordination, conjunctions, are phrases connected with a coordinator. Phrases must be able to stand alone.  
Carefully assign case to pronouns. Nominative, accusative and genitive pronouns each have a place in a sentence.  
`who` is nominative, `whom` is accusative:
* `Who kissed the bride?`
* `Whom did Henry kiss?`

Prime directive: omit needless words!  
Trim obese phrases, remove light verbs (`make`, `do`, `have`, ...) and avoid talking about concepts of concepts.  
Keep phrases short and to the point.  
Create right, not left-branching trees. Don't create noun piles.  
Read your sentence aloud. Can you do it easily?  
Avoid garden paths with:
* prosody: read it aloud
* punctuation: helps with prosody and marks phrases
* words that signal syntactic structure: small words (`the`, `are`, `that`, `which is`, ...) signal phrases
* frequent strings and senses: use the most frequent pair of words (`data point`, `horse race`, ...)
* structural parallelism: repeat parts of the previous tree structure
* attachment to the phrase next door: pull unrelated phrases apart; use subject-verb-object
* save heavy phrases for last: put ambiguous phrases and analogies at the end of a sentence
* topic, then comment: put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end; append new information at the end

Subject before object, light before heavy phrases, topic before comment.  
To achieve such structure use:
* rewrite with the opposite verb (`gave`-`received`, ...)
* passive voice
* preposing moves phrases to the left
* postposing, prepositional dative, existential and extraposed clause move phrases to the right
* clefting inverts ordering
* pseudo-clefting presupposes information

### Chapter 5: Arcs of Coherence

Apply the same rules to paragraphs as you would to sentences:
* be aware of the curse of knowledge
* treat words not as strings but as trees

Sentences must be linked to the existing web of knowledge.  

Order your sentences:
* in order in which events happened
* from the bird's eye view to the microscopic
* weave storylines for suspense
* or any other tree like ordering

Too many paragraphs is better then too few paragraphs.  

Arcs of coherense are connections between mentions of people, places and ideas.  

Lay out the topic first, then merge all sentences into it.  
Make the point sooner rather then later.  
Write in classic style: make your subject a protagonist who moves the plot.

### Chapter 6: Telling Right from Wrong

Prescriptivists and descriptivists, a false dichotomy.  
If nine tenth of people use a word incorrectly, are they still incorrect?  
Tacit conventions describe correct usage.  

If unsure how to use a word, look it up in a dictionary.  
Word usage depends on the style of writing: formal or informal, inscription or email, ...  

#### Grammar

Adverbs modify verbs and end in `-ly`.  
Flat adverbs can be both an adjective and an adverb.  
Adjectives modify either nouns or complement verbs.  

You can use `ain't`.  

You may start a sentence with a conjunction: `and`, `because`, `but`, `or`, `so` and `also`.  

Say `between you and me` not between `you and I`.  

Use `may` when asking for permission and `can` to ask for capability or possibility.  
Don't worry if you mix it up.  

Avoid dangling modifiers by inserting a subject.  
Don't force or repeat subjects if you can help it.  

Don't worry about fused participles, that is, possessives with gerunds.  

Two conditional constructions: open and remote conditional.  
Open conditional are not picky about tense.  
Remote conditionals are formulaic: if caluse must have a past-tense verb and the then-caluse must contain `would`, `should`, `could` or `might`.  
Past tense can refer to past time or to factual remoteness.  
Use pluperfect when refering to a remote possibility in the past.  

`like` and `as` can be used interchangebly.  
`such as` is more formal then `like`.  

Don't worry about possesive antecendants.  

Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.  
You can use pied-piping to take at with the `wh-`word.  

Don't worry about predicative nominative.  

Make your perspective consistent: tense (present, past), person (first, third), voice (passive, active) and type of discourse (formal, informal).  

Don't worry about when to use `shell` or when to use `will`.  

You can split infinitives, no worries.  

Don't worry about the rare subjunctive mood or irrealis were.  

Don't worry about how than and as effect pronouns.  

Use `which` when refering to a nonrestrictive and either `that` or `which` for restrictive relative clause.  
Or you can use `that` all the time.  

You can turn words into verbs. Embrace neologisms.  

`whom` is the acusative of `who`. Don't worry, just use `who`.

### Summary (of the last few pages)

Writers of the past can and have made mistakes. So will you.  
Correct usage is not the ultimate goal.  

Strive for:
* coherence
* classic style: create a window onto the world
* overcoming the curse of knowledge
* intellectual conscientiousness

To improve:
* think critically
* be factually diligent

Look things up. Don't be afraid to say I don't know.  
Make sound arguments. Start from what resonable people agree with and use `if-then` steps to arrive at your conclusion.  
An anectode or personal experience is not a trend.  
Beware of false dichotomies. Great ideas are more complex then that.  
Base arguments on reason not people. It's not about being right. It’s about getting it right.  

Style is about:
* enhancing the spread of ideas
* examplifying attention to detail
* adding to the beauty of the world
