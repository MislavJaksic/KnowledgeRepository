## Sense of Style

### Prologue

Style manuals can be considered a literary genre.  
Strunk and White's (The Element of Style) gems:  
* "Write with nouns and verbs"
* "Put the emphatic words of a sentence at the end"
* "Omit needless words"

Style is the effective use of words to engage the human mind.  
Strunk and White misdefine terms, appeal to the reader's "ear" and give contradicting advice.  
Language changes over time and their style guides, written in the beginning of the previous century should be adapted as well.  
Examples of nonsensical or bad advice:
* don't use the passive (often argued for in the passive voice)
* don't use verbs "personalize", "finalize", "host", "chair" and "debut"
* use "persons" not "people"

Don't confuse changes in yourself with changes in the world or changes in the world with moral decline — the illusion of the good old days.  
Scepticism and questioning demand reasons for why writers should follow advice in of a style guide.  
These reasons can now be given.  

The Sense of Style is for those who:
* know how to write and want to be better at it
* are curious about literature and the science of writing

Style still matters because:
* it ensures that writers will get their messages across
* style earns trust
* adds beauty to the world

### Chapter 1: Good Writing

Good writers are avid readers.  
Examining good prose is more pleasurable then obeying stern advice.  

Good writing starts strong, not with a cliché or a banality.  
Use parallel constructions.  
Use colourful, poetic language, vivid imagery and uncommon superlatives.  
Make use of the mind's eye, conjure images with unusually precise descriptions.
