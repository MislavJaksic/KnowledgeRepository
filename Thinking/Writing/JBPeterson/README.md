[Writing an Essay, by Jordan B. Peterson](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx)

## PART ONE: Introduction

* Choose a topic to write about.
    * A very hard step. You should note if something peeks your interest. You will know what it is when you are gripped by the topic. The topic can be posed as a question that you think requires an answer.

* Research the topic.
    * In order to write, you need to read. Find more knowledge or opinions about the topic. Just as before, note if something causes an emotional reaction while reading. That is an indicator that you want to explore the idea further.

* Write.
    * Produce words. Form words into sentences. Merge sentences into paragraphs. Don't stop writing to edit what you have written until you are finished writing. First, only produce. Editing will come later when you are finished writing.
    * Use words from a vocabulary that is familiar to you. Don't try to impress your reader. More often then not, that is not going to happen because you will misuse a word.
    * Write short sentences. Don't make them complex, as complexity is hard to understand. What you want is to show elegance and beauty.
    * When forming a paragraph make sure that the next sentence is connected to the previous one. Check if you can easily follow your thoughts.

* Editing.
    * When you are finished writing, take a break. Return reinvigorated and start improving what you wrote.

## PART TWO: Levels of resolution

* First: select a word. Second: create a sentence. Use precise words and place them in the correct place in a sentence. Third: merge sentences into a paragraph. A paragraph should present an idea. Your paragraph should be around 100 words long. Forth, and less obvious: paragraphs should be arranged in the correct order.

* There are also fifth, sixth and seventh level of resolution. They are essay, reader and culture. These should be considered as well.

* If you find yourself bored while writing, stop. Something is wrong. Reconsider your topic or ideas. This is an indicator that either you have chosen an unimportant topic or you are approaching a good topic in an incorrect manner.

* Choose a topic that is important to you. That way you will be able to enter into a state of mind where you will find writing exciting and beautiful.

## PART THREE: The topic and reading list

* Pose a topic in a form of a question.

* Write down what you want to read. Start with this step if you can't come up with a topic.

* While you are reading, note if something catches your interest. This might be something you disagree with or something interesting that griped you.

* Write notes using your own words. Never borough someone else's language. Express the meaning and understanding of what you have read. Take down about twice or thrice as many words as you need for an essay.

## PART FOUR: write an outline

* For a 1000 word essay, you should write 10 outline sentences. Each sentence should be an argument. Outline sentences will decide the essay's structure. You can pose them as a question.

## PART FIVE: paragraphs

* Complete each outline sentence with around 10 more sentences. This part is where you produce a draft. Don't worry about editing yet. That will come later. Write quick and dirty.

* Don't beat around the bush. Grab your audience with the first sentence or two.

## PART SIX: editing

* Try to rewrite every sentence. If the new sentence is better, keep it. Better means shorter, a result of deleting superfluous words. Better means more precise and elegant.

* Write short sentences. Each word should be chosen precisely.

* Read each sentence aloud. If it sounds weird, try to rewrite it. Rearrange the sentences within a paragraph.

* Rearrange the paragraph. See if their ordering is any better then the original.

## PART SEVEN: create a new outline

* To construct an excellent essay, do the following: without reading your original work, write down a new set of 10 outline sentences. Cut, paste, reorder and delete. Make the essay better in every way.
