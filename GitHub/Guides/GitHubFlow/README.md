## [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

The Master Branch is where the main code dwells, the production, the deployment code. You should never attempt to directly change the Master Branch.  
A Branch is a modified copy of the Master Branch. It is here that you can add new features or clean up the project.  
A Commit is the process of submitting changes to a Branch. It is made up of changes, a comment and a timeline.  
A Pull Request is a request for merging two Branches into a single Branch, most often a Master Branch. Pull Requests can be discussed and they have to be approved.  

Deploy is a phase just before merging when tests are run to insure compatibility and quality of the merging code.  
Merge is a process of combining two Branches into a single Branch.
