## [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

The Master Branch is the main code, the production or deployed code. You should never directly change it.

A Branch is a modified copy of the Master. This is where you add new features or clean up the project.

A Commit is the process of submitting changes to a branch. It is made up of changes, a comment and a timeline.

A Pull Request is a request for merging a Branch into Master. It can be discussed and has to be approved.

Deploy is a phase just before merging when tests are run to insure compatibility and quality.

Merge is a process of overwriting and adding Branch code to the Master Branch.
