## Virtualization

Virtualization is a process of creating isolated, distinct, and secure environments.  
There are different kinds of virtualisation:  
* hardware,
* OS,
* networks.

### Virtual machines

VMs virtualize hardware which decouples programs and hardware.

### Software containers

Containers virtualize operating systems which makes software easy to transport.
