## Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a very simple algorithm. Its speed complexity is O(n*n). Imagine an array made of two part, where
the right part is unsorted and the left part is. It iterates through the unsorted part of the array and compares
the element with all the previous elements in the sorted part. If the comparison is negative, it swaps the elements.
It continues like this until the comparison is positive.
