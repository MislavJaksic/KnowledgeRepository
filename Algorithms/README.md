## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions.

Algorithms are divided into folders by category and given names based on what they do or how they behave. There
are search algorithms, sorting algorithms and many other. Algorithms in this folder are written is Java, but
before they were compiled they were written and tested on a piece of paper.

### Search algorithms

Search algorithms find data in data structures, very often lists, but the structure can also be a tree or somethins else entirely. There are two main search algorithms: linear search and binary search.

### Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms order data. Data can be ordered in an ascending or descending order, in data structures or in
files. Quickly sorting large amounts of data is a common problem and therefor many sorting algorithms have been
developed. From slowest to quickest, a few well known sorting algorithms are: insertion sort,
merge sort and quick sort.
