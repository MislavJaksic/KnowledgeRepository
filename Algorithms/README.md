## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions. Its as simple as that.

Algorithms are divided into folders by category and given names based on what they do or how they behave. There
are search algorithms, sorting algorithms and many others. Algorithms in this folder are written is Java, but
before they were compiled they were constructed and checked on a piece of paper.

### Search algorithms

Search algorithms find data in data structures, very often lists, but they could also be trees or some other
structure. There are two main search algorithms: linear search and binary search.

### Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms order data. Data can be ordered in an ascending or descending order, in data structures or in
files. Quickly sorting large amounts of data is a common problem and therefor many sorting algorithms have been
developed. From slowest to quickest, here are a few well known sorting algorithms: insertion sort,
merge sort and quick sort.
