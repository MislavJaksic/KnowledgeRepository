## Virtualisation

Virtualisation is a process of creating isolated, distinct, and secure environments. There are different kinds
of virtualisation: some virtualise hardware, some virtualise OS and yet others virtualise networks.

### Virtual machines

VMs virualise hardware which decouples programs and hardware.

### Software containers

Containers virtualise operating systems which makes software easy to transport.
