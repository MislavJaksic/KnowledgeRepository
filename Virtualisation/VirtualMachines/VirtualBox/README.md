## VirtualBox

Create a Virtual Machine. Allocate enough RAM and hard disk memory. When running it the first time, select the
.iso image or the drive in which there is a DVD with the Virtual Image.

To share the clipboard/Drag'nDrop files, check the option under General Settings on the running VM.
In addition, you need to " Insert Guest Additions" under "Devices" after you run the VM.

If you want your server to be seen by the world and the host, set up a Bridged connection.
