## Virtual machines

VM is an isolated guest operating system running on a host operating system. VMs are isolated from one another
and from the host OS.

VMs can be easily destroyed and rebuilt which means that making mistakes in a VM is cheap.
VMs preserve OS settings, making deployment easier.

### Benefits of using a virtual machine

Increases hardware utilisation.
Allows the installation of a different OS on an existing OS.
Bundles OS configuration and programs so they can be transported.
Makes catastrophic errors that would normally crash an OS very easy to repair.
Emulators can even run 64-bit instructions on 32-bit hardware.

### Virtualisation software

Virtualisation software uses VM images, templates, to create VMs.
A VM image is just a bundle of programs and OS settings which can be created from an existing VM.
VMWare and VirtualBox are the most well known virtualisation programs.
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is a processor emulator.
