## Virtual machines

A VM (Virtual Machine) is an isolated guest operating system running inside a host operating system. VMs
abstract hardware unlike software containers which abstract the operating system. VMs work in isolation from
one another.
VMs can be easily destroyed and rebuilt which means that making mistakes in a VM is cheap.

### Virtualisation software

Virtualisation software create VMs from a VM image.
A VM image is just a copy of a VM, all of its applications, programs and settings.
VMWare and VirtualBox are the most well known virtualisation software.
There is also a processor emulator [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).
