## [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/index.html)

Publish static websites.  

Static Site Generators (SSG):
* Jekyll
* Hugo
* Middleman
* Harp
* Hexo
* Brunch

How it works:
* create a project
* create a folder "public" in the repository
* place your website into "public"
* setup GitLab's CICD ".gilab-ci.yml"
* setup the domain
These steps can be tested by creating a GitLab project from a GitLab Pages template.  

If youâ€™re using self-managed instances things are a bit different.
