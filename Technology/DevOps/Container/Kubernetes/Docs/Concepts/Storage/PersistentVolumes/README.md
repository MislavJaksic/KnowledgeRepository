## [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is storage provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using `StorageClass`es.  
A `PersistentVolume` is a resource in Kubernetes just like a node is a Kubernetes resource.  
`PersistentVolume` is a volume plugin, but it has an independent lifecycle.  

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is a request for storage.  
`PersistentVolumeClaim` is similar to a pod.  
Pods consume node resources and `PersistentVolumeClaim`s consume `PersistentVolume` resources.  

A `StorageClass` resource allows admins to offer a variety of `PersistentVolume`s.  

### Lifecycle of a volume and claim

PVs are resources in Kubernetes.  
PVCs are requests for PVs.  

PVs can be provisioned statically or dynamically.
If statically, a Kubernetes admin has to create a PV.  
If dynamically, a Kubernetes admin has to create a `StorageClass`. They also have to enable the `DefaultStorageClass` admission controller on the API server.  

When a PVC is created the control loop will assign it to a PV.  
The PV may be in access of what the PVC is asking.  

Pods use claims as `Volume`s.  
A PV belongs to the PVC for as long as it needs it.  
`Pod`s access claimed PVs by including a `PersistentVolumeClaim` in their `Pod`â€™s volumes block.  

A PVC is protected when the Finalizers list in a PVC includes `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection`.  
a PV is protected when the Finalizers list includes `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`.  

When done using the `Volume`, delete the PVC.  
The reclaim policy for a PV tells Kubernetes what to do with the volume after it has been released of its claim.
* retain - when the PVC is deleted the PV will exist until manually reclaimed
* delete - deletion removes both the PV and the storage asset (`AWS EBS`, `GCE PD`, `Azure Disk`, `Cinder`, ...); dynamically provisioned volumes inherit a reclim policy from `StorageClass`
* recycle - DEPRECATED; use dynamic provisioning
