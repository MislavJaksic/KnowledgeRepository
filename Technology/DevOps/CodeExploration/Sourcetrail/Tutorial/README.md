## Sourcetrail in explorer tutorials

When you open Sourcetrail you can go through the tutorials.  

They are exceptionally well good: witty, pedagogic, thorough and organized!

### Tutorial

When you open the `Project`, you are presented with the overview.  
`Code View` displays source code.  

Only the `Active Symbol` and its relations are shown.  
Change the `Active Symbol` by clicking on a `Symbol`.  

There are `Symbols` and `Local Symbols`.  

### Search Tutorial

`CTRL + F` to search for `Symbol`s.  
The `Search` autocompletes and fuzzy searches.  

Buttons:
* `Home`: to project overview
* `Back`/`Forward`: just like you are browsing the web
* `Refresh`: when your code changes

`Search` cannot find calls or inheritance.  

### Graph Tutorial

`Graph View` displays `Symbol`s and their relations.  
You can travel though the `Symbol`s using the `Graph View`.  

You can reveal additional information about the `Node` by clicking on the `V`.  

You can't active, but you can focus `Edge`s between `Node`s.  

Expand the `Graph View` class inheritance:
* `show base hierarchy`: shows all parents
* `show derived hierarchy`: shows all children

### Code Tutorial

Expand the code's scope by clicking on the line with `..` as line number.  

You cannot code inside Sourcetrail, but you can use plugins to connect it to your editor.
