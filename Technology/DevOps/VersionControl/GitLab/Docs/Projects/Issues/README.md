## [Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/index.html)

Issues can be:
* ideas
* tasks
* proposals, questions, requests, bug reports
* code elaborations

Always start with an issue!  
It avoids these problems:
* these is something you did not consider
* you are not familiar with a part of a system
* you are not aware of a limitation or possibility
* you did not understand the user
* you are solving an already solved problem

Parts of an issue:
Content: title, description, comments, activity
People: author, assignee(s)
State: open/closed, confidentiality
Planning and tracking: milestone, due date, weight, time tracking, labels, linked issues, unique issue number and URL

Issues are managed from the issue page, list, board, reference and epic.  
Issue page manages an issue.  
Issues list is where you can search and filter issues.  
Issues boards are Kanban boards.
