## [About custom domains and GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)

### Supported custom domains

Works with:
* subdomains
* apex domains

`www` subdomain recommended.  

### Using a subdomain for your GitHub Pages site

Subdomains are configured with a `CNAME` record through your DNS provider.

### Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site

An apex domain is configured with an `A`, `ALIAS`, or `ANAME` record through your DNS provider.

### Updating custom domains when your GitHub Pages site is disabled

To avoid a domain takeover, remove your DNS records if GitHub Pages are disabled.
