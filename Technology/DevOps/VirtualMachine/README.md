## Virtual machines

VM is an isolated guest operating system running on a host operating system.  
VMs are isolated from one another and from the host OS.  

VMs can be easily destroyed and rebuilt which means that making mistakes in a VM is cheap.  
VMs preserve OS settings, making deployment easier.  

### Benefits of using a virtual machine

* increases hardware utilisation.
* allows the installation of a different OS on an existing OS
* bundles OS configuration and programs so they can be transported
* makes catastrophic errors that would normally crash an OS very easy to repair
* emulators can even run 64-bit instructions on 32-bit hardware

### Virtualisation software

Virtualisation software uses VM images, templates, to create VMs.  
A VM image is just a bundle of programs and OS settings which can be created from an existing VM.  
VMWare and VirtualBox are the most well known virtualisation programs.  
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is a processor emulator.
