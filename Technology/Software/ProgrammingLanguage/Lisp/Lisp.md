## Lisp 

For Windows, download LispStick and then double click run.bat to start the
emacs. The interactive "interpreter" REPL will then open before you.

To save your defun functions, C+x C+f to make/find a file, type fileName.lisp and
then save it with C+x C+s. Write a defun into the file and compile it with C+c C+c.
To save your work after editing use C+x C+s.

After compiling, files can also be loaded into REPL with
(load "fileName.lisp").

You can open up a REPL window beside the file editing window with C+c C+z.

Lisp uses a Polish prefix notation. Example: (+ 2 3 4 5) -> 14

#Number
10
#String
"hello world"
#(format where-to-send-output what-to-output)
(format t "hello, world") -> standard output, hello world, nil
#(defun function-name (parameters) function-body)
(defun hello-world () (format t "hello, world")) -> hello-world
#(function-name)
(hello-world) -> standard output, hello world, nil
#(list arguments)
(list 1 2 3) ->
#Property list, plist, (list :symbolOne valueOne :...)
#Keyword symbols start with a colon (:)
(list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) -> 
#(getf plist :symbol)
(getf (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) :b) -> 2
#Define func with args
(defun make-cd (title artist rating ripped)
  (list :title title :artist artist :rating rating :ripped ripped))
#Define global var
(defvar *db* nil)
#(push data onto-variable)
(push (list 1 2 3 4) *db*)
#dolist macro binding a list element to a variable (dolist (variable list) do-function)
#fancy format: ~{ ~} means consume a list and do with its member what is written between the commands
#              ~a consumes one argument from a list
#              ~10t means format the previous ~a to 10 spaces
#              ~% means add a newline
(dolist (cd *db*)
  (format t "~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%" cd))
#format will output the value into *variable* instead of standard output
#(force-output var) makes sure Lisp doesn't wait for a newline before printing the prompt
#(read-line variable) reads a line of text and returns it
#return value of prompt-read will be the value of the last form, the call to READ-LINE, which returns the string it read
(defun prompt-read (prompt)
  (format *query-io* "~a: " prompt)
  (force-output *query-io*)
  (read-line *query-io*))
#validate input data with parse-integer, y-or-n-p and take a default value with or
(defun prompt-for-cd ()
  (make-cd

Common Lisp defines two black boxes, reader is the one that translates
text into Lisp objects and evaluator that implements the semantics of the
language in terms of those objects.

S-expressions: lists, atoms
  Lists: delimited by whitespace and brackets
    Elements of list: S-expressions
  Atoms: everything else
    Numbers: 12, -34, 1.0, 1.0e-4
	Strings: "foo", "f\\oo" (\ is the escape character)
	Names: format, hello-world, *db*, x, y are symbols

Naming convention:
* for global variables
+ for constants
- to separate words
; for comments
in emacs indent with TAB

Lisp form: 
any atom, any nonlist or empty list
list that has a symbol as its first element
  
Evaluator can be thought of as a function that takes a Lisp form as an
argument and returns a value.
  Atoms can be self evaluating such as strings and numbers, t and nil as
  well as keyword symbols (:a).
  Function call forms: evaluate the remaining elements of the list as Lisp forms and pass the resulting values to the named function
  Special form: special evaluation to make sure the language is capable of implementing if, loop and other features. There are around 25 
  Macro form: extend the Lisp syntax, unlike macros in other languages.
  Macro is a function that takes s-expressions as arguments and returns a
  Lisp form that's then evaluated in place of the macro form. The
  evaluation of a macro form proceeds in two phases: First, the elements
  of the macro form are passed, unevaluated, to the macro function.
  Second, the form returned by the macro function--called its expansion
  --is evaluated according to the normal evaluation rules.
  
Boolean values:
t is truth
nil is false
(), '() is nil

Equality:
always eql, never anything else
a is eql to b only if a and b have the same value and belong ot the same class. Example: (eql 1 1.0) -> nil; (eql 2 2) ->  t

Functions:
define -> (defun functionName (parameters*) "Doc string" body-form*)
optional args -> (defun foo (a b &optional c d) (list a b c d))
defulat values -> (defun foo (a &optional (b 10)) (list a b))
isArgSupplied? -> (defun foo (a &optional (c a c-supplied-p)) (list a c c-supplied-p))
rest of args -> (defun functionName (&rest numbers) ...)
keyword args -> (defun foo (&key a b c) (list a b c))
exit from a block of code -> (... (return-from foo (list i j)))

Higher order function: when functions accepts another function as an argument or when a function return a function as a return value
Store function: (function functionName) or #'functionName
Invoke stored function and you know how many arguments you are going to pass: (funcall #'functionName arg1 arg2 ...)
Invoke stored function and you don't know how many arguments you are going to pass: (apply #'functionName (list ...))

Anonymous functions (doesn't have a name):
(lambda (parameters) body)
(funcall #'(lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 2 3) -> 5
To pass lambda functions around, just prefix them with #'.

Variables:
  Lexical: local, working variables that can shadow other variables (including dynamic variables)
  Dynamic (aka special): global variables, marked with *
Lisp is dynamically typed and strongly typed.
Scoping and binding form: inner binding shadows the outer binding.
Binding form: construct that introduces a new variable name that is usable only within the construct
 By default all binding forms are lexically scoped.
 Closure: when a function closes over around the binding, so it is able to use the binding even outside the scope

 lexical binding -> (let (variable*) body-form*)
 dynamic binding -> (defparameter ...)
 constants -> (defconstant ...)
Setf behaves like =, assignment operator in C languages.
 assign a new value to a binding (lasts until you exit the scope) -> (setf place value)
Simple variable:    (setf x 10) 
Array:              (setf (aref a 0) 10)
Hash table:         (setf (gethash 'key hash) 10)
Slot named 'field': (setf (field o) 10)

Modify macros: use setf to perform an action
(incf x)    === (setf x (+ x 1)) -> increment
(decf x)    === (setf x (- x 1)) -> decrement
(incf x 10) === (setf x (+ x 10))
vars swap values -> (rotatef a b)
add var to var -> (push a b)

Macros in Lisp extend the language syntax, they can define new syntactic abstractions.

#(if condition then-form [else-form])

#when macros are run its macro expansion time; when regular code is run its runtime
#macros will generate code

#1)Write a sample call to the macro and the code it should expand into, or vice versa.
#2)Write code that generates the handwritten expansion from the arguments in the sample call.
#3)Make sure the macro abstraction doesn't "leak." that call should expand
