## Programming languages

Each languages has its own folder which is further subdivided by topic. Topics range from how to setup
a language to constructs such as lambda expressions. Each folder has a simple program designed to teach the
reader and optionally a short README.

### Program structure

The programs are all structured in a similar manner:
> _comment_explaining_the_expression_or_statement
> _expression_or_statement _comment_sign -> _result
