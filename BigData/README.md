## Big Data

Big Data is a subset of analytical problems where the volume of data is so large that it either cannot be stored in RAM
or it cannot be processed sufficiently fast by a single computer.

To solve Big Data problems, we need to use a distributed environment. Collecting, transporting and analysing
data on multiple computers in parallel spawns complex problems, Big Data problems.
