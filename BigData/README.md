## Big Data

Big Data is a subset of analytical problems where the volume of data is so large that it either cannot be stored in RAM or it cannot be processed fast enough by a single computer.

To solve Big Data problems, you need a distributed environment. Collecting, transporting and analysing data on multiple computers in parallel spawns complex problems called Big Data problems.
