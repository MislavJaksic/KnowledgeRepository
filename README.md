## Knowledge Repository

The Knowledge Repository is a collection of notes, references, book summaries and examples. Each piece of knowledge has a title and a source.  

### The Problem

The more I learn the more I forget.  
To avoid forgetting, I have to revise.  
The more knowledge I have the more time I'll spend revising instead acquiring new knowledge.  
If I spend more time revising then learning I will fall behind.  

### The Solution

To combat this, I've created a way to store knowledge outside my body: the Knowledge Repository.  
In it I can store what I know and how I was able to acquiring this  knowledge in the first place.
