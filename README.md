# Knowledge Repository

The Knowledge Repository is a collection of notes, reference sheets, book summaries and programs about software
engineering. Software engineering is a broad subject which is why the repository is divided into multiple
folders. Each folder covers a single topic or is subdivided again. Each folder has its own README which
explains the topic and its contents.


### Inspiration

The Inspiration text file contains a list of topics and books with which the Knowledge Repository may be
expanded in the future. The topics are not ordered.

### Intention

As time elapses, I will forget what I knew and even worse, I will forget how I came to know what I forgot.
To combat this reality I have decided to create this digital booklet of booklets, hoping it will keep
forgetfulness at bay. Somehow I know that writing this booklet will pay off ten years from now...

### Contact

If you are thinking about writing, do it. Correspondence is a joy to read.
