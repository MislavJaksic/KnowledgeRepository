## Knowledge Repository

The Knowledge Repository is a collection of notes, references, book summaries and examples. Software engineering is a broad subject which is why there are so many folders.  
Each folder covers a single topic. Each folder has its own README which explains its purpose and contents.

### Intention

As time elapses, I will forget what I knew and even worse, I will forget how I came to know what I forgot.  
To combat this reality I have decided to create this digital booklet of booklets, hoping it will keep forgetfulness at bay. Somehow I know that writing this booklet will pay off ten years from now...
